What the pack is:

TL;DR: Large tech-focused kitchen-sink pack with a huge amount of design/decoration mods, with a choice on skyblock or overworld.. or both, and a focus on balance, AKA no power-creep mods.

What makes the pack stand out:

Balance. No Tinkers, no draconic, thaumcraft, chickens, mystical agriculture, project e... no mods that take center-stage. There are a few end-game items, but for the most part, the mod you choose to focus on is more or less equal to any other mod you might choose.
